### Importance of Sign Language Interpretation
For the deaf community, sign language is a critical form of communication. Filipino Sign Language (FSL) serves as a bridge, but many deaf individuals face barriers due to a severe lack of qualified interpreters. According to the World Health Organization, 1.5 billion people globally have some degree of hearing loss, and the Philippines is no exception, with over 325,000 Filipinos using FSL.

### Current State of Sign Language Interpreters
In 2018, Republic Act No. 11106 was passed, declaring FSL as the national sign language of the Philippines. Despite this recognition, the availability of qualified interpreters remains limited. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges, especially during online learning and remote work, where deaf individuals struggled to participate in live conferences due to the shortage of interpreters and unstable internet connections.

### How It Can Improve
To bridge the communication gap, there is a growing need to:
1. **Expand FSL Training**: Teachers and professionals must be trained in FSL to ensure deaf students can engage in educational settings.
2. **Improve Interpreter Technology**: Leveraging machine learning and AI, like in the SENYAS project, can provide a digital solution for real-time FSL recognition, making communication easier between hearing and non-hearing communities.

By creating accessible technologies and expanding interpreter training, we can ensure a more inclusive society for the deaf.
